Database wont connect and register page wont 'grren light me' to say 'Your'e all set! Go ahead and log in!' as it tells me my password is incorrect when it isnt. The log in will not take me to the index.php page so I can see my current work on this project. Nothing has worked to get myphpadmin to recognize the data sent to it for entering into database tables.
